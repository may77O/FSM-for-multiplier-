# FSM-for-multiplier-
I need to design a Mealy Style Machine (FSM) that controls the multiplication operation in the drawing design in the drawing. But I'm not sure I understand whats going on in the drawing and how can I connect an FSM to this, I would appreciate some explanations to help me understand
